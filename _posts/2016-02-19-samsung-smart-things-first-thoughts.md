# Samsung Smart Things - first thoughts

I was very excited to receive the Samsung SmartThings starter pack for a trial - it promises to give you everything you need to get started with the IoT - the Hub which connects to the internet (by being linked to your internet router), the Things which are sensors to detect particular events, and devices to power on/off other equipment. There is also the Samsung app which you use to configure the system.

While the hardware was very nicely packaged, and seems to be very good quality, the app was very disappointing - it was very clunky to use and not at all intuitive, requiring many steps to set up something simple.

I setup a couple of alarm notifications - one for when the shed door gets opened - testing the home security; and one for when my child leaves or arrives home (using the sensor on her keyfob). Initially these worked well, giving me notifications on my iPhone within seconds of the appropriate event. However after a few weeks, the notifications became more sporadic, until eventually they hardly ever occurred. When I checked the app, the hardware was reporting the correct state, so clearly the app or central hub software was simply failing to respond to the change of state and send the notification.

> The Presense Sensor is ideal for attaching to some keys to know when someone arrives or leaves home (gets within range of the Hub) - it's a shame the software can't be bothered to tell you...

For this reason alone, I found that Samsung SmartThings is simply not (yet) fit for purpose - I can't use this for its security features if it mostly doesn't bother with the notifications!  I hope that Samsung improve the software to overcome these issues as the hardware really is very nice.
